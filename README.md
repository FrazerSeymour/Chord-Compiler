# Chord Compiler

Chord Compiler is a simple Jekyll project that compiles Markdown lyric/chord files into pretty HTML.

This project came about because I got tired of going through the process of Googling the chords for songs I like to play, turning on "desktop mode" on my phone so sites will stop nagging me about their app, only to squint at poorly formatted chords.

Now I can hand-format chords the way I want them, update how they are displayed in one place, and view them anywhere.

## Current Features

- Dockerized for your convenience.

## Future Features

- Indexing of songs.
- Pretty mobile-first formatting of songs.
- Improved search and organization of songs.
- In-browser transpose functionality.
- In-browser chord display functionality.
